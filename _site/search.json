    "text": "If you’re gonna play D&D, you need rules to give structure to the game. For veteran players, these rules will look familiar. For new folks, D&D and all it’s spinoffs follow a common structure. The Referee (classically, game or dungeon master) describes a situation. A player describes how they want to respond and act. If there is uncertainty or danger involved in the player’s decision, dice are rolled to determine how things play out. Then, the process repeats.\nThe specifics involved vary widely among different systems, and nearly every Referee has their own version of “the rules” that they run. These are the rules that I like, and I hope there’s something in here useful for you at your table.\nI’m calling these “core rules” because they form the basis of every game that I run. Depending on the setting, there are often additional rules that govern things like classes, exploration, and loot.\nThis page contains the mechanical rules that describe how the game operates. For rules about creating and leveling up Characters, head to this page.\n\nTurns\nOn your Turn, you can move and perform an action. Turns should move in some established order around the table.\nIn combat, the Referee describes what the enemy is about to do and asks each player what they would like to do in response. All rolls are made and the combat round is resolved simultaneously.\n\n\nSaves\nWhen you find yourself in danger, the Referee may call for a Save. Roll one d20. If you roll under or equal to the appropriate Ability score, you pass the Save.\nThe three Ability scores are found here.\nThe Referee will use their judgement to determine which Ability score is appropriate.\n\n\nAttacks\nAttack actions always succeed. Roll your weapon damage die and subtract the target’s armor. Attacks that are Impaired in some way roll 2 damage dice and take the lowest. Attacks that are Enhanced in some way roll 2 damage dice and take the highest. Using two one-handed weapons grants Enhanced attacks.\n\n\nDamage and armor\nDamage is subtracted from your Hit points (HP). Armor reduces damage by its number. After HP is exhausted, damage is subtracted from the Strength score. If the target takes Strength Damage, it must pass a Strength Save or become Wounded.\n\n\nWounded\nA Wounded Character is incapacitated and unable to take actions for d4 rounds or until revived by an ally. If the Wounded Character takes additional damage, they do not need to make a Save, as they are already Wounded. Taking damage when Wounded does not reset the d4 timer.\n\n\nAbility score damage\nSome enemies inflict damage that directly effects Ability scores, and of course, running out of HP leaves a target open to Strength damage.\nAt 0 Strength a Character is dead.\nAt 0 Dexterity a Character is paralyzed until they have a full rest.\nAt 0 Will a Character is comatose until they have a full rest.\n\n\nArcana\nUse an action to activate or otherwise use an Arcanum. If using the Arcanum in a way not described, make a Will save.\n\n\nFirearms\nAfter firing, you must spend 1 full Turn reloading before you fire again. You cannot move or perform other actions while reloading. If you roll a 1 on your damage roll, your gun has malfunctioned and must be repaired before use. This requires a weapon repair kit or a visit to a gunsmith.\n\n\nSpell casting\nTo cast a spell with your action, make a Will save. Spells always work, but if you fail the save you take 1d4 Will damage. If you roll a 4, then you suffer a random affliction.\n\nRandom afflictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll\nAffliction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nAmnesia  A surge of misdirected magical energy has addled your mind and you’re having trouble remembering your spells.\nUntil the Character visits their teacher or someone wise in the ways of Spell casting, they have forgotten all of their spells.\n\n\n2\nTemporary blindness  At the conlcusion of your spell your field of vision filled with radiant whiteness.\nYou’re unable to see anything for d6 turns.\n\n\n3\nExhaustion\nThe Player cannot regain HP until a Full rest.\n\n\n4\nExplosion\nThe Player is blown back by some invisible magical force. A random item the Character is carrying is destroyed.\n\n\n5\nWeight of eternity  The maw of the cosmos opened to you, and the sight nearly cost your sanity.\nAll the Character’s hair has turned grey. If their hair is already grey or they are bald, then thick grey hair now grows out of their ears. If the Character has already received this Affliction, they attempt to pick up a smoking habit as soon as the party returns to civilization.\n\n\n6\nFlow state  You’re in the zone, surfing the ragged edge of a tsunami of energy.\nThe Player can cast two spells per turn, and all spell related Will saves are Enhanced. If the Player fails a Will save they now take 2d4 Will damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom encounters\nEvery 20 minutes in a dungeon (2 rounds), when entering a new space, or when there is a loud commotion, the Referee rolls 1d6. On a 1, an encounter from that location’s table occurs. Random encounters need not always be dangers or threats.\n\n\nSupply\nWhen adventuring in the world, each player turn costs 1 “Supply”, an abstracted way to keep track of food and other resources. 1 person can hold 20 Supply, and these can be tracked with a d20 die in front of that player. At the end of their turn, the player decrements their Supply d20.\nA player may carry more than 20 Supply, at the cost of 1 Strength point per extra 10 Supply. Pack animals can carry 200 Supply. If the players forget how many Supply the animal is carrying, that animal is considered to have run away or otherwise disappeared.\nIf the players are in darkness, each turn costs 2 Supply. Using an item or tool (shovel, antitoxin) costs an extra Supply each turn the item is being used. A player need not explicitly have the item in their inventory to use it, the exception being weapons and items sold at merchants.\nRetreating or retracing already covered ground costs 0 Supply, unless a Random encounter occurs.\nIf a player runs out of Supply, all their rolls are Impaired. They will not be able to see in the dark, and they lose 1 HP per turn. A player without Supply cannot rest.\n\n\nMorale\nMost enemies will not simply flight until dead, especially groups of enemies. If a group of enemies loses roughly 1/2 of their number, they must pass a collective Will save. If they fail, they will flee or otherwise change their tactics. Lone combatants should roll this save when they reach 0 HP.\n\n\nResting\nShort rest: 10 minutes (1 turn) of rest recovers all of a Character’s lost HP.\nFull rest: After a full night of restful sleep, restore d6 points to each ability score, up to that score’s maximum.\n\n\nLuck roll\nWhen things are uncertain the Referee can make a Luck roll.\nRoll 1d6. On a low roll, fortune does not favor the players. On a high roll, fortune favors the players.\n\n\nA note on HP\nNarrating combat in a way that is both cinematic and plausible is a challenging aspect of playing the Referee. This is my recommendation for narrating combat with this system.\nThink of HP as a measure of the Character’s stamina and ability to avoid injury. Over the course of an encounter, the two sides are eroding their enemy’s ability to evade injury and continue fighting. At HP 0, you begin describing the real physical damage being inflicted to the Character’s or Monster’s Strength score.\nIf your players are fighting a werewolf, and it inflicts 1 point of damage to a Character with 10 HP, then the Character was able to smoothly avoid the attack without trouble. In contrast, if the werewolf inflicts 8 points of damage to the 10 HP Character, then the Character is barely fending off the beast.\nA great narration of the 8 points of damage would be something like, “the werewolf tackles you, slamming you into the forest floor and knocking the wind out of you. With the butt of your gun you’re managing to keep its fangs from tearing into you, but you’re hard pressed to keep it up.”\n\n\nExample random encounter table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll\nEvent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nMinotaur  HP 25, Armor 3, Great Axe d12.\nThe Minotaur knows the tunnels inside and out. He will appear without warning to attack the players, only to use a bonus movement and disappear into the tunnels. If there are 3 or more players in the same room as the minotaur, he cannot use that bonus movement.\n\n\n2\nPsychedilic fungi\nThis section of the cave is covered in layers of fungi, clearly cultivated by someone. Collections of bones hang from the ceiling, also coated in fungi. It is impossible to move through this room without touching the fungi. Players who move through make a Will save. Failure means they are unable to navigate the tunnels for d6 turns.\n\n\n3\nEscaped prisoners  HP 1\n3 humans who were captured (independently) by the minotaur and have managed to escape. They will assist in fighting and escaping, especially if supplied with weapons.\n\n\n4\nGoblin exploratory party  HP 3, Shiv d4\n4 goblins who live in the nearby Tomb of the Serpent King\n\n\n5\nShackled prisoner  HP 1\nA prisoner captured by the minotaur. He will beg to be freed, and if the players ignore him he will begin to yell in protest. This will trigger the Minotaur encounter from Roll 1 the following turn.\n\n\n6\nLoot\nRoll on the loot table\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\nThe text on this page is drawing heavily from the Into the Odd SRD.\nIn accordance with that SRD, all credit for that content due to Chris McDowall, the brilliant creator of Into the Odd.\nThe idea of Turns and Supply, come from Hankerin Furinale’s Index Card RPG\nCredit for the example Random Encounter table is due to Professor Dungeon Master and his awesome Maze of the Minotaur video"

Finding a teacher or patron can be another source of XP.\nWhen you gain enough XP to Advance, roll a d20 for each ability score. If the roll is greater than your score, raise it by 1, to a maximum of 18.\nCharacters advance along the following schedule.\n\nLevel 1 : 5 XP\nLevel 2: 10 XP\nLevel 3: 20 XP\nLevel 4: 40 XP\nLevel 5: 80 XP\n\nIf your Characters survive past Level 5, continue doubling the XP requirement for each additional level.\nXP is not cumalative.

Roll this die and add it to your maximum HP, to a maximum of 20.\nYou’ll want to create Advancement skills specific to your setting, but here are some examples.\nAt each Advancement, choose one of the below. Each Advancement includes a hit die. Roll this die and add it to your maximum HP, to a maximum of 20.\nIf your campaign is long-running, listen to your players to create further Advancement options that increase their power and cool factor.

The lense can also restore the object to its original size. It can only be applied to one object at a time. If applied to a living creature, the user must make a Will Save or the creature returns to normal size with a deformity.\n\n\n8\nObsidian dagger\nWetting this dagger with your own blood allows your spirit to project outside of your body. You can then float freely through the air and through objects. Take heed, beings that inhabit those formless realms may take notice.\n\n\n9\nWhale bone flute\nPlay a melody and make a Will Save. If you pass, your song summons an angelic being. If you can convince this being that your cause is worthwhile, make a specific request and the being will aid you.

If you fail, you take the full brunt of the damage that shattered the shield as Will damage.\n\n\n11\nMonster mask\nWhile wearing this mask any non-monstruous humanoid will be terrified of your. Wearing this in a crowded place will likely result in a mob trying to capture and kill you.\n\n\n12\nAkhashic records\nWith a specific domain of knowledge or question in mind, open this book and peer into the void. The knowledge you seek is yours. Successive uses on the same day require a Will Save. If you fail take d12 Will damage.\n\n\n13\nSeance candle\nLight this candle and call the spirit of a specific non-living person. If you light the candle in front of a corpse you can summon that person’s spirit.\n\n\n14\nBird familiar\nLeaves and sticks in the form of a bird and imbued with life. The bird behaves as an extension of your will. It has the same HP as your character. If it ever reaches 0 HP it is dead.\n\n\n15\nIvory turtle\nHumanoids that see this little carved turtle become hypnotized by its energy. Hypnotized victims make a Will Save each turn. Once they pass a Save, the turtle no longer has an effect on them.\n\n\n16\nSpider twine\nShoot a strand of sticky spider web. Enemies trapped by multiply strands must make a Strength Save to break free.\n\n\n17\nEnchanted spear\nThis finely crafted spear deals d8 damage. When thrown, it will reverse course and fly back to its owner on the next turn.\n\n\n18\nLightning spear\nThis spear has two pincer like blades that electrify on contact. Hit a target, dealing d8 damage and forcing the target to make a Strength Save. One a fail, the target is stunned for their next utrn.\n\n\n19\nMask of the leper king\nProvides 1 Armor. Anyone who lies while wearing this mask will contract leprosy.\n\n\n20\nEye of the thief\nActivate this stone carved eye to determine if your mark is carrying valuables or Arcana.
