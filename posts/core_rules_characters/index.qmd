# Creating a character

Roll 3d6 for each of your Ability scores:

* **Strength**
* **Dexterity**
* **Will**

You may choose to swap two of these scores.

Roll 1d6 for your Hit points (HP).

HP is a measure of your character’s ability to avoid life-threatening wounds.

Roll 1d100 to determine how many Schillings you have.

Roll on the starting equipment table.

The starting equipment table should vary based on your setting. There is an example table below.

# Starting equipment table

Match your highest ability score in the furthest left column with your HP on the top row to find your Starting equipment. 

If your roll includes an Arcanum then you should also roll on the [Starting arcana table](#starting-arcana).

# Character advancement

Characters gain Experience (XP) by surviving encounters and interacting with the world.

* **1 XP**: A simple encounter with minor damage
* **2 XP**: A difficult encounter with moderate damage but no fatalities
* **3 XP**: A dangerous encounter with a fatality or permanent consequences
* **4 XP**: A deadly encounter with multiple fatalities, massive damage, or harrowing retreat

Complex interactions with NPCs, especially if they are accompanied by difficult choices, should also provide XP. Finding a teacher or patron can be another source of XP.

When you gain enough XP to Advance, roll a d20 for each ability score. If the roll is greater than your score, raise it by 1, to a maximum of 18.

Characters advance along the following schedule.

* **Level 1** : 5 XP
* **Level 2**: 10 XP
* **Level 3**: 20 XP
* **Level 4**: 40 XP
* **Level 5**: 80 XP

If your Characters survive past Level 5, continue doubling the XP requirement for each additional level. 

XP is not cumalative. Everytime a character Advances to the next level their XP count returns to 0.

At each Advancement, choose an Advancement skill. Each Advancement skill includes a hit die. Roll this die and add it to your maximum HP, to a maximum of 20.

You’ll want to create Advancement skills specific to your setting, but here are some examples. 

At each Advancement, choose one of the below. Each Advancement includes a hit die. Roll this die and add it to your maximum HP, to a maximum of 20.

If your campaign is long-running, listen to your players to create further Advancement options that increase their power and cool factor.  Just be sure to make them work for it!
